# Data Analysis Tool

## A simple program for the statistical analysis of data

This program will be an intuitive and simple-to-use data analyzer where the user can enter numbers manually into data 
lists and save those lists in the program and access them freely. With the lists as the datasets, the program can also 
calculate a wide variety of summary statistics such as:
- mean
- median
- standard deviation
- variance

Further, with the datasets stored in the program, the program can also produce confidence intervals.

This program is designed to be a tool for *anyone* who is trying to do any simple data analysis. But this will mostly 
be used by students or other people who are studying or are in the field of statistics. This project is of great 
interest to me because this program if developed well could be a very convenient tool for anyone who is trying to 
calculate some simple statistics. Also, personally, as a statistics major, making a project that is closely tied to my 
field makes the project much more interesting and applicable. Once the project is finished, this will be of wonderful 
use to me. I could also, in the future, after I have completed this project as a foundation, add more statistical tests 
into the functionality of the program, developing, this into the **ultimate** tool for statistics students.
