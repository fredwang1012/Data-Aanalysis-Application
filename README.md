# Data Analysis Tool

## A simple program for statistical analysis of data

This program will be an intuitive and simple to use data analyzer where 
the user can enter numbers manually into lists and save those lists in the 
program and access them freely. With the lists as the datasets, the program
can also calculate a wide variety of summary statistics such as:
- mean 
- median
- standard deviation
- variance

Further, with the datasets stored in the 
program, the program can also produce confidence intervals and hypothesis 
test statistics and the associated p-values. 

This program is designed to be a tool for *anyone* who is trying to do any 
sort of simple data analysis. But, this will mostly be used by students or
other people who are studying or are in the field of statistics. This project
is of great interest to me because this program if developed well could be a
very convenient tool for anyone who is trying to calculate some simple 
statistics. Also, personally, as a statistics major, making a project that is 
closely tied to my field makes the project much more interesting and applicable.
Once the project is finished, this will definitely be of great use for me. I
could also in the future, after I have completed this project as a foundation,
add more statistical tests into the functionality of the program, developing,
this into the **ultimate** tool for statistics students.
